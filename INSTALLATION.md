# CLONE GIT REPO ON LINUX

  ```
 git clone --recursive https://github.com/OPALESECURITY/hardsploit-gui
 cd hardsploit-gui
  ```

# INSTALLING THE GUI

* Step by step installation (Kali Linux, Debian or Uuntu & Mac Os is supported by homebrew)

  * Open a new terminal on the desktop


  * Install packages needed (ruby must be >= 2.1) with the following command:

  ```
  apt-get install ruby ruby-dev cmake libsqlite3-dev dfu-util libqt4-dev
  ```

  * Install the gems used by Hardsploit


  if you use GCC > 5.4 you need to use GCC 5.4 at least to be sure qtbindings gem can be compile without any issue, to do that (KX UPDATE 2017-08: On Kali Linux 2017, just set CC and CCX as follows/or if you are getting compilation errors with gem install below) :
  ```
  export CC=gcc
  export CXX=g++
  ```

  ```ruby
  gem install qtbindings activerecord libusb sqlite3
  ```

   Install the GUI by using the gem

   ```ruby
   gem install hardsploit_gui
   ```

   That's it ! Hardsploit is now ready to be launched. Connect your board by USB and type in the terminal

   ```
   hardsploit_gui
   ```

   At the opening you will have in the console either this message:

   ![usb-ok](images/usb_ok.png)

   Or this one:

   ![usb-nok](/images/ok.png)

  If you have this last one, please check your USB connectivity. Don't forget that if you are using a virtual machine you have to attach Hardsploit to it.
  Hardsploit doesn't manage hotswap yet so you will have to
  * close the GUI
  * connect your board
  * launch the GUI again

  Hardsploit can be used without being connected but you will not have the possibility to execute commands or to use the wiring helper
